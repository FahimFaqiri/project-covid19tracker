# project-covid19tracker

* In this project i will create an tracker for the current pandemic, here viewers can see the current fluctuations in their own country with just a click. This project will be       created with React.js, Material UI and Charts.js.
* This code will produce a webpage containing data from an external API. This data wil be shown in both regular text and in a chart holding the data, besides that it will be         mobile friendy working with media queries.

* All the libraries used for this project
